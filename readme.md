# Pacemaker Program with Simulink and Python

## Functional Pacemaker Program Description
The logic of the program was built using model-driven development and flashed to the FRDM-K64FJ board using Simulink. Python was used to create the interface between the user and board. Python communicates with a local PostgreSQL database to store user and pacemaker data. ER diagrams have been created to communicate the structure of the PostgreSQL database.

### Intention

- Safety Critical Systems
- Embedded Systems
- Real-Time Systems
- Model-Driven Architecture
