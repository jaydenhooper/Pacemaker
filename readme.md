# Pacemaker Program with Simulink and Python

## Functional Pacemaker Program
The logic of the program was built using model-driven development and flashed to the FRDM-K64FJ board using Simulink. Python was used to create the interface between the user and board. Python communicates with a local PostgreSQL database to store user and pacemaker data. [ER diagrams](https://github.com/jennifer-hy-li/pacemakerProject/blob/main/database/Autogenerated_Diagram.png) have been created to communicate the structure of the PostgreSQL database.

### Intention
The intention behind this project is to gain experience and dive into the challenges of the following:
- Safety Critical Systems
- Embedded Systems
- Real-Time Systems
- Model-Driven Architecture
- Serial Communication
